# Security Policy

This project is a static, client-side HTML page with no server, no backend, no database, and no user data collection. Its attack surface is intentionally small, but a few things are still worth reporting responsibly.

## Scope

Please report:

- Any way the page could be made to execute untrusted script or inject content beyond its own inline code (e.g. via a crafted URL or hash value).
- Any external resource the page loads that isn't the two declared font hosts (`fonts.googleapis.com`, `fonts.gstatic.com`).
- Any factual error presented as a security claim (for example, a service described as end-to-end encrypted when it is not) — these affect real decisions people make about their privacy and safety.

Out of scope: the security posture of the third-party services listed on the page (Discord, Proton Meet, SimpleX, and the others) — please report those directly to their own teams.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Open an issue in this repository. If the report involves a factual/privacy-claim error rather than a code vulnerability, a regular issue is fine and doesn't need private disclosure. For a genuine code-level vulnerability, please avoid posting exploit details in a public issue — flag that you have a security report and a maintainer will follow up to receive details privately.

## What to expect

This is a small, volunteer-maintained static site — there's no formal SLA, but reports will be acknowledged and factual/security issues are prioritized over cosmetic ones.
